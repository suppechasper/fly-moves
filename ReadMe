Rscript requires several libraires to be installed:
MASS, RColorBrewer, cluster, hmm.discnp, depmix, shapes

And for transport stuff my package "mop" which also requires the CPLEX
optimization library from IBM.

Not well documented yet. Hard to figure what inputs are expected to the
different methods ....
