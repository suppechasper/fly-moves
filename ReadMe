The R scripts requires several libraires to be installed:
MASS, RColorBrewer, cluster, hmm.discnp, depmix, shapes

And for transport stuff my package "mop" which also requires the CPLEX
optimization library from IBM.

Not well documented yet, some of it deprecated, i.e. expects featurs 
in different format than they are now extracted. Hard to figure what 
inputs are expected to the different functions ....
